# Computer Exercise #1 - Introduction to the Lab Notebook

## By Maj Jeff Falkinburg and Capt Phillip Warner

 
### Objectives or Purpose 
This should include a paragraph on what is the goal of this assignment?

Remember, the purpose of the lab notebook is to communicate EVERYTHING you have done in pursuit of a particular project.  If you are sitting on the bus scribbling on the back of an envelope about your lab design, take a picture of that and include it with your work.  Without adequate documentation, your instructor won’t know what your thought process was and will not be able to grade you properly.  Once you leave the school environment, fellow engineers may need to pick up your project where you left off if you PCA, PCS, get hospitalized, or otherwise find yourself no longer working on something.  You will save your employer/co-workers/replacement a lot of time and money if you have left a detailed record for them to easily understand what you were doing, the approach you took, the tests you performed, and what you learned.


### Preliminary design
How will you start attacking the problem?
This should include detailed instructions of what you are about to do.  It may include PreLab material and also information from the Lab Handout.  Use pictures and data from Lab Handout.
You may also use snippets of code in here as well:

#### Software flow chart or pseudocode
All coding include a pseudocode flow charts and algorithms defined your code and the algorithms used.  Visio or PowerPoint works well for this!

#### Schematic drafts
Include any initial drafts of your schematics (hardware, state transition diagrams, etc).  If you are wiring hardware up you will definitely need to create a schematic for your design.


### Testing methodology
Detail the steps in getting the results you system is designed to achieve.  Have enough detail that someone can come behind and reproduce your results.


### Design
Use this section to detail anything important for the reader to understand about your final design.  At a minimum you need to explain anything that is different from you preliminary design and why you had to change it.

**Generally, you should not include code in your README.**  You may include small code snippets in your README that are important for your explanations, however.  

**Use well-formatted code.**  All of your code should be in a code/ folder and written with:

1. headers
2. comments
3. good coding practices.

#### Schematics
Final schematics should be neatly computer generated.


### Debugging
You should be keeping track of issues as you go along.  I didn't have any problems is not a good answer.  Describe the problems you had and what you did to fix it.  Again this is where I would say commit early and often and start your notebook when you start your code.


### Results
Display your results and describe them in detail so that anyone can understand.  For example Figure 1 below shows a screenshot of a memory dump for RAM from 0x0200 to 0x024E.  You will also describe to the reader what they are looking at.

### Answers to Lab Questions
Here is where you would answer any lab questions given in the lab writeup.


### Observations and Conclusions
During this whole assignment, what did you learn?  What did you notice that was noteworthy?  This should be a paragraph starting with the purpose, whether or not you achieved that purpose, what you learned, and how you can use this for future labs.


### Documentation
– always include this.  Any help received on any portion of the assignment, even from an instructor or the internet should be specifically mentioned.
